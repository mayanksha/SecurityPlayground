		This is great! XOR Cipher is the one in which str1 is some secret key string which is used to perform XOR operation to another string. Now, if A XOR B = C then C ^ B = A.
		We firstly need to find that secret key. We can XOR cookie_data and defaultdata to get key. 
		We can then replace that secret key with (cookie_data XOR defaultdata) and then switch yes to no and then send that cookie data.
		FFS, please ensure that base64 encoded data always ends with = sign
